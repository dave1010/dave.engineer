I want this site to be usable by as many people as possible. The design aims for clear typography, strong color contrast, semantic HTML, and keyboard-friendly navigation.

### What’s in place

- Keyboard navigation and visible focus states.
- A skip-to-content link to jump straight to the main content.
- Structured headings and semantic landmarks.
- Responsive layouts that reflow on smaller screens.

### Feedback
