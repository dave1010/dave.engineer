Hello, World.

This site is still static HTML but now built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on Cloudflare Pages, rather than being handwritten HTML on GitHub Pages.

This means it's easier for me to add content and will hopefully result in the site being kept up to date. If it's not then please [bug me](https://github.com/dave1010/dave.engineer/issues/new).

I'm also working on consolidating various blogs into one place (here).
My blog posts from 2012-2015 from [createopen.com](https://createopen.com/) are already here on [dave.engineer/blog](https://dave.engineer/blog). Let me know if you have ideas for what to do with the old domain.
