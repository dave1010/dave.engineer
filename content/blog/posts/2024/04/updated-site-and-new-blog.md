Hello, World.

This site is still static HTML but now built with 11ty and hosted on Cloudflare Pages, rather than being handwritten HTML on GitHub Pages.

This means it's easier for me to add content and will hopefully result in the site being kept up to date. If it's not then please bug me (new GH issue).

I'm also working on consolidating various blogs into one place (here).
My blog posts from 2012-2015 from createopen.com are already here on dave.engineer/blog . Let me know if you have ideas for what to do with the old domain.
