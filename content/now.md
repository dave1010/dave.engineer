Right now I’m focused on three threads:

- **Building reliable, AI-aware systems** that help teams ship dependable software.
- **Engineering leadership and culture**, especially how we scale decision-making and improve developer experience.
- **Public transport technology**, with an emphasis on data quality, compliance, and long-term maintainability.

When I’m not working, I’m usually experimenting with open-source tooling, tinkering with 3D printing, or getting out for a run along the coast.
