I'm a Principal Engineer at [Passenger](https://www.passengerteam.com/), where I help shape the future of public transport technology from Bournemouth in the UK. My day-to-day work moves between hands-on engineering, shaping technical strategy, and ensuring teams have the clarity and confidence they need to deliver.

Over the past two decades I've led teams building consumer products, large-scale platforms, and internal developer tooling. My focus is on dependable systems, healthy engineering cultures, and using AI in ways that create leverage for people instead of replacing them.

## What I'm working on

- **Engineering leadership:** creating the structures, rituals, and metrics that let teams move quickly without losing sight of reliability.
- **AI strategy:** partnering with stakeholders to identify pragmatic ways machine learning can augment products and operations.
- **Compliance and governance:** translating regulatory requirements into lightweight processes and tooling that scale.

## Beyond the desk

When I'm not building software I'm usually exploring the Dorset coastline with my family, reading about transport history, or experimenting with new ways to teach engineers the craft of building maintainable systems.
