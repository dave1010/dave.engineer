I’m a Principal Engineer at [Passenger](https://passenger.tech/) in Bournemouth, UK, where I help design and scale technology used by millions of people every day.

My work spans architecture, backend systems with PHP as my primary language, data and geospatial services, e-commerce, and the occasional bit of frontend or native app development. I'm also involved in information security and technical strategy.

I’m particularly interested in agentic AI, developer experience and organisational culture. I explore these themes through open-source projects and writing on my blog and on Wardley Leadership Strategies, where I think out loud about leadership, effective AI, and technology adoption.

I occasionally speak at user groups and conferences on topics about how we think and build: ranging from coding and TDD, to cognitive biases and post-quantum cryptography.

Outside of work, you might find me experimenting with open-source tools, 3D printing, or running somewhere along the coast.
