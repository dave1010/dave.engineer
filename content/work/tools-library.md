The Tools Library brings together quick, focused utilities that remove friction from day-to-day development and content tasks. Most tools run entirely in the browser with no accounts or tracking, so you can convert formats, debug data, or explore ideas without sacrificing privacy.

The site was inspired by [tools.simonwillison.net](https://tools.simonwillison.net/). As with Simon's, it's all open source and the the tools are nearly all *vibe coded*. For me, the site serves as a testbed for trying out different AI coding agents.

One of my favourite tools *is* a coding agent, of sorts: [Prompt to Web Page](https://tools.dave.engineer/tools/prompt-to-web-page/). It uses the GPT-OSS-120B LLM, running on Cerebras. Type something like

> Tic tac toe but with animals

and it will create a game in under 5 seconds. The tool also lets you save them as a GitHub Gist so you can share them. [Here's one I made 5 seconds ago](https://gistpreview.github.io/?291a8a1e7c1f4adc6b356e8250cad1d1).
