Back in June 2023, before ChatGPT had "GPTs", OpenAI created a plugin system that allowed the model to call tools via APIs. My idea was that the most powerful and flexible tool is the command line, so why not give ChatGPT access to tyour shell?

Pandora is a powerful coding companion that connects ChatGPT with your local development environment. It can edit files,
run commands, manage Docker containers, send desktop notifications and manage sensitive information without it being sent to the LLM.

ChatGPT plugins have been discontinued and the world has now moved on to MCP.

I wrote more about Pandora in the blog post [Making Pandora, a super-charged coding plugin for ChatGPT](/blog/posts/2023/08/making-pandora-a-super-charged-coding-plugin-for-chatgpt/).
