Letter Unboxed helps puzzlers explore every possible solution to the New York Times Letter Boxed challenge. The responsive web interface makes it easy to toggle each character between available, required, or excluded states so you can quickly experiment with different strategies. Optional grouping rules ensure consecutive letters rotate through distinct sides of the box, mimicking the puzzle's official constraints.

For power users, the project ships with an identical command-line interface. You can filter massive dictionaries with the same
options as the UI, enforce starting or ending letters, and sort results by length or alphabetically. Both interfaces share the
same filtering engine, keeping puzzle solving fast whether you prefer a browser or the terminal.
