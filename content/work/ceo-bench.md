CEO Bench evaluates how reliably large language models can respond to complex leadership scenarios. The benchmark generates
realistic executive-level questions, collects model answers, and scores them against an automatic rubric so teams can compare
performance over time. Everything is transparent: the prompts, responses, and scoring scripts live in the open.

The project is designed for iteration. Researchers can plug in new models, tweak the rubric, or propose entirely new scenarios
via GitHub. The resulting leaderboard makes it easy to spot strengths, weaknesses, and regressions as the field advances.
