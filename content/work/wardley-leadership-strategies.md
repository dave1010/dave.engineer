Wardley Leadership Strategies turns the theory of Wardley Maps into actionable leadership guidance. I curate and maintain the
playbook, distilling community insights into concrete moves that leaders can try immediately. The entire site and content are
published under a Creative Commons license so other teams can remix and build on the material.

The project stays close to the community. Each pattern is tested through conversations with practitioners, and readers are
encouraged to contribute their own tactics through GitHub. By keeping the code and content open, Wardley Leadership Strategies
serves as both a living reference and a collaboration hub for strategic leadership experiments.
