**Asdfghjkl** is a tiny macOS productivity tool I wrote in Swift.

It overlays a 4×10 lettered grid across all connected displays so you can steer the mouse entirely from the keyboard. Each keystroke zooms into the matching cell until the pointer snaps to your target, giving pixel-level precision without using the trackpad.
