Hack the Bus turns prompt-injection defense into a competitive sport. Two teams race in real time: the red team crafts creative
attacks against an LLM-powered ticketing system while the blue team patches vulnerabilities and protects passengers. The gameplay teaches the risks of *prompt injection* and
mirrors real-world incident response, forcing players to weigh speed against safety.

Building the experience required orchestrating AI agents, a shared game state, and fast feedback loops so players could
see the impact of each move.
