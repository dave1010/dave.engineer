Hubcap was my first AI coding agent, built as a working proof of concept in August 2023.

Just like Claude Code (released Feb 2025), OpenAI Codex CLI (April 2025), and others, you can give Hubcap a goal and it will keep going until its done.

Hubcap works surprisingly well but isn't safe or as useful as more modern coding agents.

Hubcap demonstrates how far a compact AI agent can go in just a few lines of code.
