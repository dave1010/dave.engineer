EMF Planner helps attendees plan their time at [Electromagnetic Field](https://www.emfcamp.org/). The web app turns the sprawling festival lineup into a
clean two-dimensional timetable, making it easy to spot overlaps, filter by interests, and pin must-see sessions. Everything
updates as the programme shifts so you can keep your schedule accurate right up to the event.
